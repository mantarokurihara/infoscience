1. What did we do?

Today, we looked at the Computational Thinking, which consists of Deconstructing, Pattern Recognition, Abstraction and Algorithm Design.
We applied this process with creating jam sandwiches, and made our own set of instruction that we asked Dr. Pinzon to follow.

2. What did you learn?

I learned that it was surprisingly difficult to give a clear and algorithmic set of instructions for even such a simple task like making a jam sandwich.

3. What question(s) do I have?

How does computational thinking really apply when we start programming?
